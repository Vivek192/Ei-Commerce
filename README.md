# Ei-Commerce
I created an E-commerce website for a project during the hiring process at Ei Study. I used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including classes, objects, constructors, super keyword, member functions, and the "this" keyword. The website was built using React JS and styled with CSS to look good on various devices like iPads, tablets, TVs, laptops, and desktops.

To manage the state and data, I implemented Context API and used hooks like useState and useEffect. I made the website responsive so that it works well on different screen sizes.

In terms of functionality, I added some cool features like a buy one get one free offer and a 20% discount on specific products. I avoided using a lot of "if else" statements in the code by implementing some clever logic. I also utilized custom hooks and the map function to efficiently handle and display the products in the E-commerce store.
