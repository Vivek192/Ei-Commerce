# Ei-Commerce
Created a React JS E-commerce site with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Used classes, objects, constructors, and "this" for structured code. Responsive design, Context API, and hooks like useState. Implemented buy one get one free, 20% discounts with minimal if-else. Custom hooks and map for efficient product handling.
